## hickv's blog

Welcome. I will eventually start writting about gamedev and other cool tech stuff.

My main focus is going to be:
- Computer Graphics
- Shaders
- HPC
- Game Development in general

I used to play around with Unity, but I got bored of it. Currently, I am considering migrating to Bevy, because it seems like it is the future in terms of performance and scalability.
